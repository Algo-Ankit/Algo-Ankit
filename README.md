### 💡 My Philosophy & Interests

* **Problem-First Mindset:** I believe the most elegant solutions come from a deep understanding of the problem itself. I love cracking tough challenges, whether it’s a complex algorithm, a system design puzzle, or a business process.

* **Full-Stack Curiosity:** My passion for technology isn't just limited to software. I'm fascinated by the entire stack, from scalable AI applications down to the physics of semiconductor fabrication.

* **Competitive Spirit:** Outside of code, I'm an avid FPS gamer and tennis player. I bring the same focus and drive for improvement from the game server and the court to my development work.
